## Overview

- Java is one of the worldâ€™s most important and widely used computer languages.
- Java is loaded with lots of features like Open Source, Simple, Secure, Portable, Object Oriented, Multithreaded, Interpreted and Distributed.
- Java Basic Terminologies

  - **JCP:** The Java Community Process is the process that formalizes and standardizes Java technologies.
  - **JSR:** The Java Specification Requests is used to introduce new technologies into the language. Not all JSR specifications are taken up by the language.
  - **JDK:** The Java Development Kit is a complete Java development platform with JavaCompiler, JavaDocs and JavaDebugger
  - **JRE:** The Java Runtime Environment provides an environment where Java applications can run effectively.
  - **JVM:** The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is responsible for supporting the execution of Java applications.
  - **JCL:** The Java Class Library is a set of standard libraries that is available to any application running on the JVM.
  - **Java EE:** The Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) was created to extend the Java SE by adding a set of specifications that define capabilities commonly used by enterprise applications.

## History

- History of Java programming language is usually associated with origin predates of the web. Below is the evolution of Java
  - In **1991, The Green Project at Sun Micro Systems(now Oracle)** begins looking for a purpose. They take apart many electronic devices, like cable TV set-top boxes and remote controls to find a way for the appliances to talk to each other.
  - The Green Project (Naughton, Gosling and Sheridan) settles on smart consumer electronics as the delivery platform. **Gosling** starts development of a **new programming language and by August 1991, James Gosling at Sun created a language C++ ++**. His friends asked to name it something else and then he called it as **Oka (on the name of tree found outside his window)**.
  - By **October 1992**, 7 inch a cross between a PDA and a remote control, is ready. This is demoed to **Scott McNealy** who is blown away. Following that demo, the Green Project is set up as **First Person Inc**, a wholly owned Sun subsidiary.
  - In **early 1993**, The Green Project hears about a **Time-Warner request for proposal for a setup box operating system**. First Person Inc quickly shifts focus from smart consumer electronics (which is proving to be more hype than reality) to the **setup box OS market**, and place a bid with Time-Warner. They lose the bid.
  - In **early 1994**, First Person Inc concludes that like smart consumer electronics setup boxes were more hype than reality. Without a market to be seen **First Person is rolled back into Sun**.
  - After failing at interactive media, people at Sun sat together in a coffee shop to figure out what they have to do with Oak and decided rename it to **Java by Gosling after looking at the menu**.
  - In **1994**, a team of Java developers started writing **Web Runner, which was a clone of the internet browser Mosaic**. It was based on the Java programming language. The name Web Runner was a tribute to the Blade Runner movie. Web Runner's first public demonstration was given by **John Gage and James Gosling at the Technology Entertainment Design Conference in Monterey, California in 1995**. It was later renamed **Hot Java, it was officially announced in May the same year at the Sun World conference**.
  - **Hot Java was a modular, extensible web browser from Sun Microsystems implemented in Java**. It was the first browser to support **Java applets**, and was Sun's demonstration platform for the then-new technology.
