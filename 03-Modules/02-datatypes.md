## Data Types, Variables, and Arrays

- Java is a Strongly typed language.it means that every variable  and expression has a type and it is strictly defined and .
- Java compiler checks for type compatibility during assignments ,parameters passing to methods.
- Java has two types of data types.
    - **Primitive Data Types(simple Data types)**
    - **Reference/Object Data Types**
- Java has eight primitive data types.They are **byte**,**short**,**int**,**long**,**char**, **float**,**double** and **boolean**.

| Data Type |                         Contents                        |  Size  | Default Value |
|:---------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|:------:|:-------------:|
|    Byte   |    Signed two's complement integer from -128 to 127     |  8-bit |       0       |
|   short   |  signed two's complement integer from -2^15 to 2^15 -1  | 16-bit |       0       |
|    int    |   signed two's complement integer from -2^31 to 2^31-1  | 32-bit |       0       |
|    long   |   signed two's complement integer from -2^63 to 2^63-1  | 64-bit |       0L      |
|  float    |          single precision floating point number           | 32-bit |  0.0f |
|  double |           double precision floating point number          | 64-bit |  0.0d |
| boolean |             stores boolean value true or false            |  1-bit | false |
|   char  | Stores 16-bit unicode character from '\u0000' to '\ffff'  | 16-bit |   -   |
